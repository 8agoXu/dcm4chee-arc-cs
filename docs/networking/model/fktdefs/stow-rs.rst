STOW-RS
"""""""

The reception of a STOW-RS POST request will activate the STOW-RS Service. The storage request is based upon the accept headers in the STOW-RS POST request. The response includes an HTTP status line, including a status-code and its associated textual phrase, followed by an XML message indicating success, warning, or failure for each instance stored by the STOW-RS service.
